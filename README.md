 CorelCad toolbar set up
Installed CorelCad 2016, then had to remove the program after toolbars were not displaying properly or visible in the program.
Reinstalled CorelCad a few times however no toolbars are visible. Attempted to recreate toolbars using the user interface. 
Also had to repair Microsoft Visual Studio files.
Installed CorelDraw free version and this seemed to affect CorelCad toolbars, so I deleted CorelDraw and ended up deleting CorelCad due to the unavailability of the toolbar function.
